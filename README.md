# Hello world 
This is my first repository. <br />
I dont know how to use github or what anything means but im willing to learn it <br />
I like doing projects with computers and my raspberry pi's <br />
I also really like Pokemon mystery dungeon <br />
I have soldered in the past and I really enjoy it <br />
I enjoy coding but I am not really good at it. <br />
The coding languages I do know a bit of are html, css, and java script.
