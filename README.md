# Hello world 
This is my first repository.__
I dont know how to use github or what anything means but im willing to learn it
I like doing projects with computers and my raspberry pi's
I also really like Pokemon mystery dungeon
I have soldered in the past and I really enjoy it 
I enjoy coding but I am not really good at it.
The coding languages I do know a bit of are html, css, and java script.
